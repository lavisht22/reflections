Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A. Bug was basically a type, and bugs are caused by typos. So if we can find the difference and
locate a typo we can find the bug.

Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
A. We can easily revert back the wrong changes and find out the typing or synatx errors.

Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A. Pros:
	1. Properly Coded Commits (now compilation errors)
	2. Flexibility

   Cons:
   	1. Need to think when to save the commit and when not.

Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A. As Git is meant for projects and project have multiple files so, to have a proper version control, 
Git allows saving multiple files in one commit.

Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A. I can use these commands to view the changes I've made in the source files and bug tracking would
be easy. Also the history of files give an idea, how the project has changed over time.

Q. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break 
something?
A. I will have confidence as I can easily change to a pervious version if something breaks.

Q. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A. I want to use it to add version control to my Android Studio Project.
